A simple Flutter app that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using shared preferences. It allows users to perform basic data management tasks, such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting data locally using shared preferences.

## Features
- Create: Add new data entries to the app.
- Read: View existing data entries.
- Update: Modify and update existing data.
- Delete: Remove unwanted data entries.

## Upcoming Features
I have exciting plans to enhance the app with more data storage options:

- Local File Support: Users will be able to store data in local files like .txt or .json for more persistent storage.

- SQLite Integration: The app will incorporate SQLite for efficient and structured database storage.

- Hive Integration: I plan to integrate Hive, a lightweight and fast NoSQL database, for added flexibility.

## Usage
Clone the repository using the following command:
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/crud-data-in-flutter.git
- Open the project in your favorite Flutter IDE (Android Studio, VS Code, etc.).
- Run the app on your emulator or physical device.

## Contribution
Any contributions to improve and expand the app's functionality is welcomed. If you find any bugs or have new ideas for features, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.
